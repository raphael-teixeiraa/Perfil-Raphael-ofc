## Hello there, stranger

I don't really know how you landed here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you. ;)

## Public information

My name is Daniel Reis, a.k.a DanielHe4rt. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and my goal is to help many developers to achieve their goals as soon as possible.

I founded [He4rt Developers](https://github.com/he4rt) in 2018, a community focused to help junior developers into their baby-steps. For 5 years I leaded and learned community management there and now my next step is to create a global community. (soon)

I've also streaming [LiveCoding sessions at Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/danielhe4rt) almost daily since 2018 by learning concepts and teaching at the same time, elevating the "Learn in Public" concept to a whole new level. With that, started to write articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/danielhe4rt) and create videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/danielhe4rt), which was the  game changer action for my Career as a Developer.
